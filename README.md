A new Flutter project based on the site: https://news.ycombinator.com/.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application where I try to use a firebase API to get information and turn it into an app.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
